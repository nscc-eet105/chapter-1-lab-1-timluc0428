psalm_23 = "\nAdonai, my shepherd:\n \
\tI know no need.\n \
In lush meadows\n \
\tyou invite my soul to rest and recline; together\n\n \
we walk beside the dance of light on quiet waters.\n \
\tYou give me back myself,\n \
point me to the road toward justice,\n \
\tone of your sacred names.\n\n \
Even when I walk in a valley\n \
\tdark as the shadow of death,\n \
I know no fear, for you are near me\n \
\twith your staff and crook, and I am safe.\n\n \
You spread out a feast before me\n \
\twith those who were my enemies.\n \
You touch my head with fragrant oil;\n \
\tmy thanks overflows.\n\n \
May goodness and mercy\n \
\tfollow me all the days of my life,\n \
and may I make my home\n \
\tin the house of the Lord forever."
