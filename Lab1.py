#storing poem text as variable psalm_23
psalm_23 = """\nAdonai, my shepherd:
\tI know no need.
In lush meadows
\tyou invite my soul to rest and recline; together\n
we walk beside the dance of light on quiet waters.
\tYou give me back myself,
point me to the road toward justice,
\tone of your sacred names.\n
Even when I walk in a valley
\tdark as the shadow of death,
I know no fear, for you are near me
\twith your staff and crook, and I am safe.\n
You spread out a feast before me
\twith those who were my enemies.
You touch my head with fragrant oil;
\tmy thanks overflows.\n
May goodness and mercy
\tfollow me all the days of my life,
and may I make my home
\tin the house of the Lord forever."""
